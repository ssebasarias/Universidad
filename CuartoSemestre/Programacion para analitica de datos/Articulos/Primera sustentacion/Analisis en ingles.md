This text discusses the challenges facing traditional methods of economic and financial forecasting in the era of "big data".

Traditional methods have problems predicting trend changes during emergency situations, have a limitation in the depth of data analysis in segmented fields of economics and finance, and may have common statistical biases in data collection. In addition, the current economic situation is very complex, which requires the expansion of traditional forecasting technology and the development of forecasting models that can quantify various complex economic phenomena.

Economic and financial forecasting methods driven by big data focus on practical application, but ignore theoretical aspects. To use this technology, it is necessary to collect data from different sources, apply machine learning techniques, build comprehensive prediction frameworks, and create prediction-related data assets.

Research in this field focuses on the complexity of systems based on big data analysis. Prediction methods no longer rely on traditional hypothesis testing rules and model recognition techniques, but focus on prediction accuracy.

The text also discusses how to extend prediction theory in economics and finance in the face of large amounts of data with complex characteristics. It is suggested to focus on building models that can process unstructured data and to take into account spatio-temporal characteristics.
