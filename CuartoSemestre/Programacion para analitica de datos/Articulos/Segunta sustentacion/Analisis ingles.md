The article is a study that estimates the consumer surplus that Uber generates for consumers in San Francisco, one of the cities where Uber has been operating since 2010. The study uses three data sets: the individual-level choice data set, the 2008-2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), the origin-destination level data set, Uber data and 2017 Google data. The study uses a discrete choice framework to identify consumer preferences in 2008 and assumes that these preferences have not changed in 2017. Then, the study reveals passenger demand for different modes of transportation in 2017 and calculates consumer surplus by subtracting the consumer surplus in the scenario where Uber is available from the consumer surplus in the scenario where Uber is not available.

The data used in the study come from diverse and complementary sources. The NHTS is a survey conducted by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) that collects information on trips made by American households during one day. The study uses this dataset to estimate consumer preferences in 2008 and to obtain information on socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of travelers. Uber data is provided by the company and contains information on average duration and average fare for rides between grid cells in September 2016. The study uses this data to obtain information on supply and price of Uber in San Francisco. Google data is collected by the study using Google Maps APIs. The study requests data on transportation mode attributes between grid cells, such as duration, cost, and distance, for each origin-destination pair and each available mode of transportation (car, bus, bicycle, and walk).

The study divides all of San Francisco into 4 square kilometer grid cells and defines an origin-destination (OD) pair as either two different grid cells or the same cell. The study considers four modes of transportation: car, bus, bicycle, and walking. The study estimates a multinomial logit model with fixed effects by OD to identify consumer preferences in 2008 from the NHTS. The study assumes that these preferences have not changed in 2017 and uses the coefficients of the logit model to reveal passenger demand for different modes of transportation in 2017 from Google data. The study calculates consumer surplus as the difference between expected utility of consumers with and without Uber.

The study finds that Uber generates at least $0.76 of benefit per ride and that the total consumer surplus generated by Uber in San Francisco is around $100 million per year. The study also finds that consumer surplus varies depending on market conditions and Uber's dynamic pricing policy (or "surge" pricing). The study concludes that the effects that Uber has on the transportation industry are complex, and potential costs for the industry and benefits for passengers must be balanced.

The study has some limitations. For example, the study assumes that consumer preferences have not changed since 2008, which may not be true due to technological and social changes. The study also assumes that Uber does not affect the supply or demand of other modes of transportation, which may not be true due to substitutive or complementary effects. The study also focuses solely on San Francisco, which may limit generalization of its results to other cities or countries.

This study has some implications for the regulation of Uber and other ride-sharing services. For example, the study shows that Uber generates significant benefit for consumers, and this benefit may vary depending on market conditions and Uber's dynamic pricing policy (or "surge" pricing). The study suggests that regulatory authorities should consider these benefits when designing rules and regulations for Uber and other similar services. The study also suggests that more research is needed to evaluate the social and environmental effects of Uber and other ride-sharing services.
